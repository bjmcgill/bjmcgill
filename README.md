**Software Developer | Creative Technologist | Conservation Advocate**

As Treasurer and Webmaster for the Bee Sanctuary Movement, I combine my passion for environmental conservation with technical expertise to support Manchester's leading bee conservation charity. I develop digital solutions for green space redevelopment initiatives while managing financial operations and public education programs.

**Technical Expertise**
I build practical software solutions, including Tallis Ledgerâ€”a streamlined accounting system designed specifically for small charities. My programming foundation in Python encompasses GUI development with Tkinter and Qt, complemented by hands-on experience from the University of Helsinki's advanced programming course, where I developed an arcade game as my capstone project.

Currently expanding into JavaScript, full-stack development, and AI integration using APIs to create innovative tools that solve real-world problems.

**Creative Development**
I bridge technology and storytelling through interactive media. My published works include "Quest of the Mysteries," a text adventure game built in Inform 7 (available on IFDB.org), and "The Elder Agenda," an occult-themed novel available on Amazon. I'm particularly interested in combining Unity with Ink to create narrative-driven gaming experiences.

**Beyond Code**
When not programming, I maintain an active lifestyle with daily gym sessions and cultivate my appreciation for classical music through platforms like Medici.tv, Amazon Music, and BBC Sounds.

**What's Next**
I'm seeking software development opportunities where I can apply my technical skills, creative problem-solving approach, and commitment to meaningful projects that make a positive impact.
